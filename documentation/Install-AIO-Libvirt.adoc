= All In One: AIO Libvirt

[discrete]
== Overview

If you plan to deploy the RHEL9-Workshop in a libvirt/kvm based environment, you are in luck.  These playbooks can automate everything including the setup of the libvirt/kvm host itself.

Using this configuration, RHEL9 Workshop nodes will be deployed as virtual machines in a NAT'd internal network.  You can easily change this to a bridged network by using alternate configuration answer files.

NAT is easy because:

  * dhcp, pxe don't conflict with public network
  * the outside world cannot reach your cluster nodes directly

After setup of the libvirt host is complete, the bastion host and supporting nodes are built from a DVD and post-configured with ansible playbooks to set up the various exercises.

Lastly, these are default configurations on the virt host but can be changed in the config files:

  * vm images will go into /home/virt-images
  * iso images will got into /home/iso
  * network is NAT by default with 192.168.127.xxx and r9workshop.example.com as internal domain.

Virt host should be loaded with either RHEL 8.6+, RHEL 9.0+


[discrete]
== Prerequisites

  * RHEL 9.0+ or 8.6+ base installation
  * Installed packages: git, ansible 2.9 or ansible-core
  * RHEL 9.0+ or 8.6+ DVD ISO saved in /home/iso
  * RHEL 9.0+ or 8.6+ BOOT ISO saved in /home/iso

[discrete]
== Register system

However you get it done, the primary virthost system will need access to additional RHEL repos.  At this time, I'm testing on RHEL 9.2 and RHEL 8.6.

For RHEL 9.2:

    - "rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms"

For RHEL 8.6:

    - "rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms"
    - "rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms"

And yes, I test with CentOS from time to time and it should work as both the virthost platform and for the workshop nodes.


== Install Git

WARNING: this process requires and is tested with ansible 2.9.  Anything older that Ansible 2.9 *WILL NOT WORK!!!*

Besides an @Base installation, you will need git and ansible installed before you begin.  Once installed, the playbooks will take care of the rest.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
yum -y install git
----

== Retrieve RHEL 9.0/8.6 DVD and BOOT ISOs

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
mkdir -p /home/iso/
----

Now log into the Red Hat customer portal (https://access.redhat.com) and download the needed ISOs.  You can copy the URL from the download button, but be sure to use single quotes to prevent bash from parsing the string.  Some example commands are provided below.  Remember, YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THE URL!

----
wget -O /home/iso/rhel-baseos-9.2-x86_64-dvd.iso '<URL>'
wget -O /home/iso/rhel-baseos-9.2-x86_64-boot.iso '<URL>'
wget -O /home/iso/rhel-8.6-x86_64-dvd.iso '<URL>'
wget -O /home/iso/rhel-8.6-x86_64-boot.iso '<URL>'
----

== Git Clone Repo

Still on your virt host:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
cd /usr/local/src
git clone http://github.com/xtophd/RHEL9-Workshop -b rhel92-dev --recurse-submodules
----

== Copy the default answer file

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
cd /usr/local/src/RHEL9-Workshop
cp ./sample-configs/libvirt-nat/rhel9-workshop-setup.ans ./config
----

== Run the Setup (Configuration) Script

Time to run the new installation helper script.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
./sample-configs/rhel9-workshop-setup.sh
----

For the libvirt-nat setup, the default options should all work.  The only thing that needs to be done is
set the passwords for the ansible-vault, workshop-admin and workshop user.
Just step through the options and enter the values.

When ready, get back to the main menu and select "Prepare Deployment".  The configuration files will
get generated and the deployment should be ready to go.

In sumary, the script will: 

  * collect necessary information
  * install ansible or ansible-collections
  * create the config files with the adjusted values


[#_final_checklist]
== Final Check List 

    - Is there enough memory?
    - Is there enough cpu?
    - Is there enough disk space and is it in the right location?
    - Is the RHEL ISO downloaded and stored in the right place
    - Did you install (upgrade) Ansible 2.9+


== AIO-Libvirt Platform Setup

This step runs the playbooks that setup the virtualization platform.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
cd /usr/local/src/RHEL9-Workshop
./xtoph-deploy.sh setup
----

== AIO-Libvirt Workshop Deployment

This step runs the playbooks that create the VMs and deploy the RHEL9-Workshop.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
cd /usr/local/src/RHEL9-Workshop
./xtoph-deploy.sh deploy
----

When it's done, you can ssh to the bastion host and get started with the exercises.


== Get Started with the RHEL9-Workshop

ifdef::env-github[]
The workshop document and exercises can be found here:

* link:{docsdir}/RHEL9-Workshop.adoc[RHEL9-Workshop Hands-on Lab]
endif::[]




[appendix]
== VNC Connection to the bastion host

WARNING: As of Aug 2023, this is a new set of instructions being developed to help deploy the workshop on a single host using RHEL 9 with libvirt virtualization.  Please be patient, everything should be resolved shortly.

If enabled in master-config.yml (now the default for the libvirt-nat.yml), a VNC server is configured on the bastion host.

You could then use an ssh tunnel to setup up a port on the virt host which will connect to the bastion vm.  If you left all of the default parameters and substituting your-host-ipaddr, run the following on the libvirt host.

----
firewall-cmd --add-port=5903/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5903/tcp
ssh -L <your-host-ipaddr>:5903:192.168.127.110:5903 root@192.168.127.110 -N
----

Now you should be able to use VNC client to connect to <your-host-ipaddr>:3

Don't forget to set the display quality to "High" in the VNC connection properties, and increase the display resolution on the bastion's desktop GUI settings.

[appendix]
== Manual Configuration

=== Install Ansible

There are a pair of handy scripts to install ansible.  The first is useful IF you have an entitlement for your system and can utilize the Red Hat Subscription Manager (rhsm).  The second script will configure the use of the EPEL repo install an unsupported (community) version of ansible.

To install ansible using rhsm:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
cd ~/RHEL9-Workshop
./sample-scripts/rhel9-install-ansible-rhsm.sh
----

To install ansible using epel:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
cd ~/RHEL9-Workshop
./sample-scripts/rhel9-install-ansible-epel.sh
----

=== Copy NAT configurations to './config' directory

Using the NAT'd network config will require the least amount of changes to the config.  You really only need to provide the provide proper info for IP address space.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
cd ~/RHEL9-Workshop/config
cp ../sample-configs/libvirt-nat/* .
----

=== Edit the Config Files

NOTE: Any changes you make to the files in './config/' will be left untouched in the event you update the project repo with `git pull`.  Git is configured to ignore files in ../config

WARNING: Adjusting the default dns and timeserver for your home/lab is critical and is almost certainly mandatory.  You will find those parameters in master-config.yml (network_nameserver and network_timeserver)

It is paramount that you update the configs for your environment accurately.  Please pay close attention to the general network information, and of course the IP and MAC addresses for your systems (vms).  In a libvirt (or ovirt) environment, the default behaviour is to allow the playbooks to generate MAC addresses.  The randomly generated MACs are stored and will persist in the configs until the config directory is deleted (../config/host_vars/*).


==== master-config.yml

NOTE: Again, MAC addresses for a libvirt deployment are automatically generated.  You only need to create/edit MAC addresses if you want to assign them yourself.

Just like the name implies 'master-config.yml' is the main configuration file.  Most parameters should be straight forward, but in particular you need to:

  * adjust the dns and time servers (MANDATORY!!!)
  * fix hostnames, mac addresses & ip addresses
  

==== credentials.yml

WARNING: ENCRYPT THIS FILE WHEN DONE EDITING!

There are 2 variables that need to be defined in this file:

  * rhel9workshop_student_password
  * rhel9workshop_admin_password
  
The default rhel9workshop_student_name is `cloud-user` with an empty password.  Create a password for the user and then save save the file.
 
Now you can use ansible-vault to encrypt the file for improved security:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
ansible-vault encrypt ~/RHEL9-Workshop/config/credentials.yml
----

Create a password and remember it.  You will need it shortly.

If you want to make changes to the contents of the credentials you can do the following:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
ansible-vault edit config/credentials.yml
----

==== Return to Normal Workflow

Now you can return to the section titled link:#_final_checklist[Final Check List] and resume the deployment from there.
