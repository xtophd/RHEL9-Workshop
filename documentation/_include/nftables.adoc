= Introducing NFTables

== Overview

NFTables is the subsystem of the Linux kernel which provides filtering and classification of network packets, datagrams, or frames. This software provides an in-kernel packet classification framework that is based on a network-specific Virtual Machine (VM) and a new nft userspace command line tool.

That is a lot of words to say: NFTables is a system that inspects network packets to and from your system, and based on a set of rules does something with those packets (ie: accept, deny, forward).

Primary benefits over the older system (iptables):

  * Better performance
  * Better usability



== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will be using the host `node2` as user `root`.

From host `bastion`, ssh to `node2`.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
ssh node2
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----

=== Disable Firewalld

For this unit, we also need to ensure firewalld is disabled.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
systemctl disable firewalld --now
----

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
systemctl enable nftables --now
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

== Core Concepts

It is not unusual for this subsystem of the linux kernel to get replaced from time to time.  You may be familiar with some of the prior filter systems:

  * ip-firewall (linux kernel v2.0, managed with ipfwadm)
  * ip-chains (linux kernel v2.2, managed with ipchains)
  * ip-tables (linux kernel v2.4, managed with iptables)
  * nf-tables (linux kernel v3.13, managed with nft)

There are others, but these are the most famliar ones that appeared in the major distributions.

In RHEL 9, you have a choice on how to implement and manage the firewall.  In which scenario should you use one of the following?

  * *firewalld*: easy to use and covers traditional firewall use cases
  * *nftables*: for complex and performance critical firewalls
  * *iptables*: the nf_tables API provides backward compatibility so that scripts that use iptables commands still work

For 99% of all use cases the firewalld tools are the best choice.  For this lab however we are trying to introduce `nft` and demonstrate some differences to the former `iptables`.

Let us now begin to understand the constructs that build the firewall rules: Tables, Chains & Rules.



=== Tables

Fundamentally speaking, filter rules are organized into chains and the chains are then further organized into tables.

Tables are the top-level construct within the nftables ruleset.

A table consists of:

  * *chains*
  * *sets*
  * *maps*
  * *flowtables*
  * *stateful objects*

Each table belongs to exactly one family:

  * *ip* - IPv4
  * *ip6* - IPv6
  * *inet* - both IPv4 and IPv6
  * *arp* 
  * *bridge*
  * *netdev*

So your ruleset requires at least one table for each family you want to filter.

Using nft, show the current state of the network tables.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft list tables
----

There is nothing there, so let us create a new table called 'workshop'

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft add table inet workshop
----

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft list tables
----


[{format_cmd_output}]
----
table inet workshop
----



=== Chains

NOTE: Unlike in iptables, there are no predefined chains like INPUT, OUTPUT, etc. 

A *chain* is a collection of attached *rules* that take action on network packets (ie: accept, drop).

Chain types are:

  * *filter* -  filters packets (supported by the arp, bridge, ip, ip6 and inet families)
  * *route* - reroutes packets (supported by the ip, ip6 and inet families)
  * *nat* -  performs Networking Address Translation (supported by the ip, ip6 and inet families)

Hooks you can use:

  * *ingress* - sees packets immediately after passed up from NIC driver, before prerouting (only in netdev family since Linux kernel 4.2, and inet family since Linux kernel 5.10)
  * *prerouting* : sees all incoming packets, before any routing decision has been made
  * *input* : sees incoming packets that are addressed to and have now been routed to the local system
  * *forward* : sees incoming packets that are not addressed to the local system
  * *output* : sees packets that originated from processes in the local machine
  * *postrouting* : sees all packets after routing, just before they leave the local system

Using nft, show the current state of the network chains.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft list chains
----

Again there is nothing there, so let use create a new chain in our table called 'INPUT'.

NOTE: nft re-uses special characters (ie: curly braces and semicolons) so using single quotes is needed in this case

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft 'add chain inet workshop INPUT { type filter hook input priority 0 ; }'
----

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
*nft list chains*
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
table inet workshop {
        chain INPUT {
                type filter hook input priority filter; policy accept;
        }
}
----



=== Rules

*Rules* take actions (ie: accept, drop, forward) on network packets based on specified criteria.

  * a rule consists of zero or more *expressions* followed by one or more *statements*
  * each *expression* tests whether a packet matches a specific payload field or packet/flow metadata
  * if a packet matches all of the expressions in the rule, then the rule's *statements* are executed

Using the Table and Chain created above, let's proceed to implement and manage some basic rules.



== Exercise: Managing Rules

=== Add Single Rule

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft insert rule inet workshop INPUT tcp dport http counter
----

Verify the rule change.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft -n -a list table inet workshop
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
table inet workshop { # handle 2
        chain INPUT { # handle 1
                type filter hook input priority 0; policy accept;
                tcp dport 80 counter packets 0 bytes 0 # handle 4
        }
}
----

Now is a good time to point out that the exercises in this unit are deliberately meant to be nondestructive.  Meaning, we don't want this machine to be unusable due to an error in rule insertion or deletion.

So what does the previous rule do?  It merely counts packets that arrived at port 80 on our machine.  Let's send some packets.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
curl localhost
----

There is no web server running on this system so you will get a failed connection message.  However, now we reexamine the counters.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft -n -a list table inet workshop
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
table inet workshop { # handle 2
        chain INPUT { # handle 1
                type filter hook input priority 0; policy accept;
                tcp dport 80 counter packets 2 bytes 140 # handle 4
        }
}
----

Not too exciting, but now you know how to add a rule.

=== Delete Single Rule

Deleting rules takes a little care in that you have to identify a *handle*.  Again, listing the rules make note of the *handle* provided next to each rule.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft -n -a list table inet workshop
----


[{format_cmd_output}]
----
table inet workshop { # handle 2
        chain INPUT { # handle 1
                type filter hook input priority 0; policy accept;
                tcp dport 80 counter packets 2 bytes 140 # *handle 4*
        }
}
----

We can now use that *handle* to delete the rule.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft delete rule inet workshop INPUT handle 4
----

Verify the rule change.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft -n -a list table inet workshop
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
table inet workshop { # handle 2
        chain INPUT { # handle 1
                type filter hook input priority 0; policy accept;
        }
}
----



=== Add Multiple Rules at Once

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft insert rule inet workshop INPUT tcp dport { ssh, http, https, 8181 } counter
----

Verify the new rules.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft -n -a list table inet workshop
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
table inet workshop { # handle 2
        chain INPUT { # handle 1
                type filter hook input priority 0; policy accept;
                tcp dport { 22, 80, 443, 8181 } counter packets 10 bytes 712 # handle 6
        }
}
----

Again, our chosen hook (counter) is meant primarily to be a nondestructive rule.  By using the *input* hook and applying the *accept* and *drop* policies, you get into the business of recreating a firewall.  Let's go ahead and cleanup and restore firewalld and take one last look at the state of the system.



=== Cleanup

Remove the chain added during this exercise.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft flush table inet workshop
----

Now delete the table

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft delete table inet workshop
----

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
systemctl disable nftables --now
----

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
systemctl enable firewalld --now
----

And now check out how firewalld has built the ruleset in the netfilter.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft list tables
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
table inet firewalld
----

Word of caution, the output here is long...

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
nft -n -a list table inet firewalld
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
table inet firewalld { # handle 3
        chain mangle_PREROUTING { # handle 127
                type filter hook prerouting priority -140; policy accept;
                jump mangle_PREROUTING_ZONES # handle 131
        }

        chain mangle_PREROUTING_POLICIES_pre { # handle 128
                jump mangle_PRE_policy_allow-host-ipv6 # handle 297
        }

        chain mangle_PREROUTING_ZONES { # handle 129
                iifname "eth0" goto mangle_PRE_public # handle 306
                goto mangle_PRE_public # handle 261
        }

        chain mangle_PREROUTING_POLICIES_post { # handle 130
        }

        chain nat_PREROUTING { # handle 132
                type nat hook prerouting priority -90; policy accept;
                jump nat_PREROUTING_ZONES # handle 136
        }

<... SNIP ...>
----


Now consider all of those rules to implement these basic firewall policies...

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
firewall-cmd --list-all
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
public (active)
  target: default
  icmp-block-inversion: no
  interfaces: eth0
  sources:
  services: cockpit dhcpv6-client ssh
  ports:
  protocols:
  forward: yes
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports:
  source-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:
----

Which is why we encourage you to use firewalld and firewall-cmd for 99% of your netfilter needs.

== Conclusion

That concludes this unit on nftables.

Time to finish this unit and return the shell to it's home position.
