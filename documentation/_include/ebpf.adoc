= BPF Tracing - Observability of System Performance

== Overview

WARNING:  This exercise requires the SECONDARY terminal and conflicts with any other exercise that
uses the secondary terminal.  Do not proceed if the secondary terminal is already in use with another exercise.

eBPF (The Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is an in-kernel virtual machine that allows code execution in the kernel space, in a restricted sandbox environment with access to a limited set of functions. There are numerous components shipped by Red Hat that utilize the eBPF virtual machine. Each component is in a different development phase, and thus not all components are currently fully supported. Those that are not supported are available as a *Technology Preview* and are not intended for production use. For information on Red Hat scope of support for Technology Preview features, see: link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

In this unit, we will be focusing on the kernel tracing offering shipped as bcc-tools (BPF Compiler Collection Tools).   We will also touch on bpftrace which is a tool  to compile scripts to BPF-bytecode.  


== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will primarily be using the host `node2` as user `root`.  However, these exercises do REQUIRE a second terminal session to run commands on other hosts.  Please pay careful attention to what commands to run on different hosts.

TIP: Now is a great time to use the multi session capability of *tmux*.  Use `Ctrl-b "` to create another session with a split screen.  Cycle the active session back and forth with `CTRL-b n` (next) and `CTRL-b p` (previous).

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

From host `bastion`, ssh to `node2`.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
ssh node2
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
workshop-ebpf-checkhost.sh
----

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal (bastion)

To help you set up your second terminal, here is the ssh command and password which you can use.

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
[[ $(hostname -s) != "bastion" ]] && {ssh_command} -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no"
----

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
{ssh_password}
----

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

== Core Concepts

There are just over 100 tools shipped in this package. A few things of note:

     * All of these tools live in `/usr/share/bcc/tools`.
     * These tools must run as the root user as any eBPF program can read kernel data. As such, injecting eBPF bytecode as a regular user is not allowed in RHEL 9.
     * Each tool has a man page to view the man page, run `man <tool name>`. These man pages include descriptions of the tools, provide the options that can be called and have information on the expected overhead of the specific tool.


=== Installation

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

Start by installing the *BPF Compiler Collection* (bcc-tools) and kernel-devel packages for the installed kernel:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
dnf install bcc-tools bpftrace strace kernel-devel-$(uname -r) -y
----

Now, we have a lot of interesting tools installed in /usr/share/bcc/tools along with accompanying man pages.





== Exercise: tcplife

The `tcplife` tool monitors tcp connections on the system and measures the amount of time that they've been open, the local and remote ports involved in the connection and the amount of data transferred and received in kilobytes.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

To run this tool, execute the following and give it a couple of seconds to get set up:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
/usr/share/bcc/tools/tcplife
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
PID   COMM       LADDR           LPORT RADDR           RPORT TX_KB RX_KB MS
----

WARNING: It is important to wait until the tool is setup.  Do not proceed until you see the output headers (displayed above) appear.

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal (bastion)

Run a little script to generate some user activity.

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "sudo workshop-ebpf-rootkit.sh"
----

This command should run for about 10 seconds and then exit.  Before proceeding to the results you can
either hit `Ctrl-C` in the primary terminal OR send a sigkill to the process to terminate tcplife.

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "pkill tcplife"
----

[discrete]
==== Results 

In the primary terminal, you should now see output similar to:

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
PID   COMM       LADDR           LPORT RADDR           RPORT TX_KB RX_KB MS
28478 sshd       10.0.0.12       22    10.0.0.10       33514    14     2 9091.95
----

Doing the math with the numbers above, this session was open for about 9 seconds and was initiated by IP 10.0.0.10 (the bastion host).

In the `tcplife` terminal, issue a Ctrl-C and this will return you to a prompt.





== Exercise: execsnoop

The `execsnoop` script monitors all calls to execve() and catches all processes that follow the fork->exec sequence, as well as processes that re-exec() themselves. Processes that fork() but do not exec() won't be caught by this script.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

Continuing on host `node2`, to run `execsnoop` as follows:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
/usr/share/bcc/tools/execsnoop
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
PCOMM            PID    PPID   RET ARGS
----

WARNING: It is important to wait until the tool is setup.  Do not proceed until you see the output headers (displayed above) appear.

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal (bastion)

In your second terminal having established yourself as root, run the following command:

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "sudo workshop-ebpf-rootkit.sh"
----

Again, this command should run for about 10 seconds and then exit.  Before porceeding to the results you can
either hit `Ctrl-C` in the primary terminal OR send a sigkill to the process to terminate execsnoop.

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "pkill execsnoop"
----

[discrete]
==== Results

In the primary terminal, you should see output similar to:

[{format_plane}]
----

firewall-cmd     28542  28516    0 /usr/bin/firewall-cmd --state
----

This shows you all the processes that ran exec() during that ssh login, their PID, their parent PID, their return code, and the arguments that were sent to the process. You could keep monitoring this for quite some time to catch potential bad actors on the system.



== Exercise: mountsnoop

Similar in nature to `execsnoop`, `mountsnoop` traces the mount() and umount() syscalls which show processes that are attempting to mount (or unmount) filesystems.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

To run this tool, execute the following and give it a couple of seconds to get set up:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
/usr/share/bcc/tools/mountsnoop
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
COMM             PID     TID     MNT_NS      CALL
----

WARNING: It is important to wait until the tool is setup.  Do not proceed until you see the output headers (displayed above) appear.

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal (bastion)

In your second terminal having established yourself as root, let's try to unmount a something we know can NOT be unmounted. For this, we'll pick the root filesystem '/'.

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "sudo workshop-ebpf-unmountroot.sh"
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
umount: /: target is busy.
----

[discrete]
==== Results

Taking a look at the terminal running `mountsnoop`, we see:

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
umount           20001   20001   4026531840  umount("/", 0x0) = -EBUSY
----

This shows us that the mount is busy and cannot be unmounted.

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal (bastion)

Now let's try to unmount a filesystem that we should be able to unmount.  But before doing so, look at the mount options to ensure we can restore it correctly.  On `node2` run the following:

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "grep /dev/shm /proc/mounts"
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs *rw,seclabel,nosuid,nodev,relatime* 0 0
----

Now proceed to umount `/dev/shm` on `node2`

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "sudo workshop-ebpf-unmountshm.sh"
----

[discrete]
==== Results

Back to the primary terminal and you should see the following:

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
umount           20003   20003   4026531840  umount("/dev/shm", 0x0) = 0
----

The umount command succeeded. 

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal (bastion)

Proceed to restore the /dev/shm mount as follows:

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "sudo workshop-ebpf-mountshm.sh"
----

This is the last step related to mountsnoop.  Before porceeding to the results you can
either hit `Ctrl-C` in the primary terminal OR send a sigkill to the process to terminate mountsnoop.

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "pkill mountsnoop"
----

[discrete]
==== Results

Finally, back to the primary terminal you should see the following:

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
mount            48024   48024   1832832     mount("tmpfs", "/dev/shm", "tmpfs", MS_NOSUID|MS_NODEV, "seclabel,inode64") = 0
----

This shows us that the mount succeeded and all the options that were passed into the system call.

As you can see, the `mountsnoop` tool is very useful for seeing what processes that are calling the mount and umount system calls and what the results of those calls are.

In the `mountsnoop` terminal, issue a Ctrl-C and this will return you to a prompt.



== Exercise: cachestat

The `cachestat` tool traces kernel page cache functions and prints every five second summaries to aid you in workload characterization.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

To run this tool, execute the following and give it a couple of seconds to get set up:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
/usr/share/bcc/tools/cachestat 5
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
   TOTAL   MISSES     HITS  DIRTIES   BUFFERS_MB  CACHED_MB
----

WARNING: It is important to wait until the tool is setup.  Do not proceed until you see the output headers (displayed above) appear.

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal (bastion)

Let's now run a little exercise that will generate some i/o.  This script 
flushes the cache and then runs a series of `dd` commands.

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "workshop-ebpf-cachestat.sh"
----


This command should run for a few seconds and then exit.  Before porceeding to the results you can
either hit `Ctrl-C` in the primary terminal OR send a sigkill to the process to terminate cachestat.

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "pkill cachestat"
----


[discrete]
==== Results

In the `cachestat` window, you should output similar to:

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
    HITS   MISSES  DIRTIES HITRATIO   BUFFERS_MB  CACHED_MB
   16016     1216        0   92.94%            0        266
    8891        0        0  100.00%            0        322
       0        0        0    0.00%            0        322
----

This shows that we had 1216 page cache misses during a five second period while running the above loop but during that same period, there were 16016 hits, indicating great performance from the page cache.



== Exercise: bpftrace

This tool is a swiss army knife allowing you to specify functions to trace and messages to be printed when certain conditions are met.

bpftrace makes use of:

  * BCC for interacting with the Linux BPF system
  * as well as existing Linux tracing capabilities: 
    * kernel dynamic tracing (kprobes)
    * user-level dynamic tracing (uprobes)
    * tracepoints
 

Let us start this educational journey by examining what system calls a simple command executes.  

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

To begin, we need a test file to use as our target.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
touch /tmp/workshop.tmp
----

The command we will evaluate is `cat /tmp/workshop.tmp` and we will use strace to list the system calls
made and with what frequency (count). 

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
strace -c cat /tmp/workshop.tmp
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----

100.00    0.000925           7       119        15 total
----

What we see is that our command used the 'openat' systemcall 31 times.  Among those calls, 13 resulted in errors but 
are likely harmless attempts to open files that do not exist.



=== bpftrace: count all syscalls 

Next, let's use *bpftrace* to create a similar output of counted system calls.  We will use a wildcarded tracepoint 'sys_enter_*'
to get all the relevant syscalls.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_* { if (comm == "cat") { @[probe] = count(); } }' -c "cat /tmp/workshop.tmp"
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
Attaching 337 probes...


@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_access]: 1
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_futex]: 1
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_set_tid_address]: 1
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_set_robust_list]: 1
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_prlimit64]: 1
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_fadvise64]: 1
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_getrandom]: 1
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_exit_group]: 1
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_munmap]: 2
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_arch_prctl]: 2
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_brk]: 3
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_mprotect]: 4
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_pread64]: 4
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_read]: 4
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_newfstatat]: 19
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_close]: 20
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_mmap]: 22
@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat]: 31

----

This should line up almost 1-to-1 with the previous output from strace, note that 'sys_enter_openat' is 31.



=== bpftrace: count specific syscall 

Now we are going to limit the probe to only show 'sys_enter_openat' thereby only setting 1 probe and collecting a count.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat { if (comm == "cat") { @[probe] = count(); } }' -c "cat /tmp/workshop.tmp"
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
Attaching 1 probe...


@[tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat]: 31

----



=== bpftrace: set probe on specific file

NOTE: For this last exercise we will utilize both terminal sessions again.  

The objective is to set a probe and identify any process that opens our targeted file.

    * -e [PROBE CODE]
    ** *tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat:* is the tracepoint probe type (kernel static tracing)
    ** conditional if() to evaluate args->filename for a match
    ** print() the desired output
    *** typical *pid*, *uid*, *gid* fields
    *** *comm* is process's name
    *** *args->filename* is the filename being accessed
    * -c [COMMAND] to run command after probes are set and exit


[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal (node2)

Proceed to set the probe in the primary terminal.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat { if (str(args->filename) == "/tmp/workshop.tmp") { printf( "%d %d %d %s %s\n", pid, uid, gid, comm, str(args->filename)); }}'
----


[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal (bastion)

To generate some output, you will need to utilize the second terminal and open the target with a couple of different tools.  From the bastion host, run the following:

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "cat /tmp/workshop.tmp"
----

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "grep something /tmp/workshop.tmp"
----

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "echo < /tmp/workshop.tmp"
----

This is the last step related to bpftrace.  Before porceeding to the results you can
either hit `Ctrl-C` in the primary terminal OR send a sigkill to the process to terminate bpftrace.

[{format_cmd_exec2}]
----
ssh node2 "pkill bpftrace"
----
