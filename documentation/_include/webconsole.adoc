= Web Console

== Overview

Web Console is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 web-based graphical user interface designed for managing and monitoring your local system.  The Web Console can also be extended to manage multiple servers located in your network.

Features of the Web Console include:

  * Managing user accounts
  * Managing and monitoring system services
  * Configuring network interfaces
  * Configuring firewall rules
  * Reviewing system logs
  * Managing virtual machines
  * Creating diagnostic reports
  * Setting kernel dump configuration
  * Configuring SELinux
  * Installing and Updating software
  * Managing System Subscriptions
  * more...

The following exercises will cover some of the capabilities of the Web Console on RHEL 9, as well as basic installation and set up.

== Getting Started

The following instructions to install and configure the webconsole are only provided as informational.  All of the exercises will actually be performed using a dedicated web broswer.

== Installation and Configuration

For your convenience, the webconsole has already been installed and configured on *bastion* host.  The steps for installation and setup are pretty simple and outlined below.  Remember that this is provided as reference only.

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to install and enable the Web Console_
[{format_cmd_output}]
----
dnf install -y cockpit firewalld tuned
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
----
====

That completes the installation and configuration of the Web Console.



== Webconsole Login

NOTE:  Please note that by default, the webconsole is configured to use port 9090.  Thus you would normally add :9090 to the end of the URL.  However for the purposes of this lab and to provide the greatest degree of internet compatability the webconsole has been additionally enabled on port 443.

Your instructors (or workshop portal) may provide you with a unique link and special instructions to access the web-console on the *bastion*. It is PREFERRED that you use your local web browser.

Accept the various notifications about insecure ceritificates, and then login in.

Use the following URL:

  * link:https://{targethost_fqdn}/[] 

And the following UserID and Password:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
%ssh_username%
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
%ssh_password%
----

== Webconsole Overview

After you successfully sign-on, you will land on the overview page which presents various artifacts about your system including:

  * CPU utilization
  * Memory Utilization
  * Disk I/O
  * Network traffic

Also make note that your userid needs "Administrative Access", and since the userid is configured on the host as part of the "wheel" security group you are presented with the option to turn administrative access on.

====
image::Slide2.PNG[Cockpit Overview]
====

Please proceed to enable administrative access and then verify.

====
image::Slide3.PNG[Cockpit Overview]

== Enable Persistent Metrics

It's nice that certain statistics about your system are available for inspection, but by default the webconsole does NOT store statistics long term.  For this, you need to install “Performance Co-pilot (pcp)”, the cockpit-pcp plugin and lastly enable "persistent metrics collection" in the webconsole.

Start by clicking on the link "View metrics and history" on the "Usage" tile.

====
image::Slide4.PNG[View details and history]
====

Next, we need to enable the collection of metrics data.

====
image::Slide5.PNG[Metrics Settings]
====

====
image::Slide6.PNG[Enable Metrics]
====

If your system has not already had the Performance Copilot packages installed, a dialog box should have appeared to confirm the automatic install.  In our case, the software is already installed and you can proceed to view some performance data.

Take a moment to review the available performance information.  Since the workshop likely has not be up for very long, there is probably nothing interesting to see yet.  Towards the end of the workshop, return to this page and see your performance data.

====
image::Slide7.PNG[Performance Charts]
====

To configure and enable stored metrics by hand, you can use follow the commands below.

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to enable stored metrics_
[{format_cmd_output}]
----
dnf install -y cockpit-pcp
systemctl restart cockpit.socket
----

== Change Performance Profile

RHEL 9 comes with several pre-canned performance tuning profiles from Tuned. Since this is a virtual machine, the default profile “virtual-guest” was selected. You can easily switch profile via the Web Console web UI. In this exercise, we will change the profile to “throughput-performance”

====
image::Slide8.PNG[Cockpit Perf Profile]
====

A dialog box will appear.  Scroll and find "throughput-performance" and select.

====
image::Slide9.PNG[Cockpit Perf Throughout]
====



== View Logs

Under the log section, you can inspect the system's logs.

====
image::Slide10.PNG[Cockpit Logs]
====

Have a look at the search capabilities and notice that you can set criteria by:

  * Time
  * Priority
  * Service

You can also build a filter rule to customize your output.

====
image::Slide11.PNG[Cockpit Logs Criteria]
====



== Network Management

Under the networking section, you can monitor and manage current networking activities and devices. You can create a network bond, team, bridge, and vlan all driven by the webconsle GUI.

Due to the nature of workshops, we refrain from making and saving changes to the network at this time but feel free to explore available options and configuration choices.

====
image::Slide12.PNG[Cockpit Network]
====



== Firewall Management

Also under the networking section, you can configure your firewall rules. 

For the next exercise, let's enable a rule for NTP (Network Time Protocol).  Begin by selecting the Networking category and "Edit rules and zones".

====
image::Slide13.PNG[Cockpit Firewall]
====

Now you should see a list of active services and ports.  Proceed to select "Add services"

====
image::Slide14.PNG[Cockpit Firewall Service]
====

In the dialog box enter 'ntp' as the filter, select 'ntp' and hit "Add services".

====
image::Slide15.PNG[Cockpit Firewall Dialog]
====



== Service Management

Now that you enabled a NTP firewall rule, let’s make sure an NTP service provider is enabled and running under the Web Console Services section.

Remember that RHEL 9 uses a provider called 'chrony' for ntp.  So you can search for either 'chrony' or 'ntp'.

====
image::Slide16.PNG[Cockpit Services]
====

Turns out, chronyd is already enabled and active.  Nothing to do here...

====
image::Slide17.PNG[Cockpit Services]
====



== Remote Node Management

The core functionality of being able to manage multiple nodes from a single interface has been intergrated into the webconsole base.  Now adding additional nodes and selecting one to manage is simple and intuitive.

We begin by selecting the pull-down in the top-left corner.

====
image::Slide18.PNG[Cockpit Services]
====

Now it is only a matter of selecting 'Add new host' and entering a few data points.

====
image::Slide19.PNG[Cockpit Services]
====

Add the additional systems from your workshop cluster.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*node1.{subdomain}*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*node2.{subdomain}*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*node3.{subdomain}*
----

====
image::Slide20.PNG[Cockpit Add Nodes]
====

Now when you hit the pull-down, you have complete access and managibility of the additional nodes.

====
image::Slide21.PNG[Cockpit Remote Nodes]
====

Go ahead and select node1 and then access a terminal session. Very handy!

====

== Conclusion

This concludes a short exercise with Web Console. Feel free to click through and explore other sections:

* Under *Accounts* section, you can manage user accounts on your RHEL 9 server
* *Diagnostic Reports* allows you to create sosreport for Red Hat support
* Under *Kernel Dump*, you can enable/disable kdump

You will get an opportunity to manager Virtual Machines and Build System Images in later exercises.
